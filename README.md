## Start the project
Make sure you are on develop or master branch

Run the following commands:

  

```

npm i

npm run startdb

npm start

```
Go to http://localhost:5000 and check this app out
You can also check the API by using the following routes
- http://localhost:3000/users
- http://localhost:3000/roles
- http://localhost:3000/projects
- http://localhost:3000/relations

To submit the form, all the inputs must be filled. Once the form is submitted, open the browser console and check if you get a success message.

## Considerations

I only create one file (index.js) for actions and other for reducers as it is as small project. I did not create action type file for the same reason either.
The part of testing is not done because I know very little about testing in React and I did not have so much time to perfom the task. Anyway, It is something pending to be learnt by me.


>Versions of node and npm were the app was fully tested: 8.9.4 and 6.4.1 respectively
